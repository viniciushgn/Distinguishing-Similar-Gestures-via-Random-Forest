# Distinguishing Similar Gestures via Random Forest

This repository houses the research paper titled "Distinguishing Similar Gestures via Random Forest," authored by Vinicius Hirono Goncalves under the guidance of Dra. Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (FEEC) at the University of Campinas (Unicamp). The paper explores the application of Random Forest algorithms to differentiate between similar intentional and unintentional user movements captured by mobile accelerometers.
